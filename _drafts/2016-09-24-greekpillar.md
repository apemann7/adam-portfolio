GreekPillar is a software startup founded at Lehigh University. In Summer 2016, I worked for GreekPillar as a software developer doing work on their new platform.

### Summary  
While a part of GreekPillar, I worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and AngularJS to help design and improve the platform. I was involved in everything from market research and ideation to design and implementation. We contacted hundreds of colleges across the United States with Greek Life in order to find out how they do recruitment and what tools would be useful for them to improve their process. After gathering this information, I worked with the Co-Founders, Joseph O'Brien and Greg Potter, to come up with a simple but feature-rich user experience for both the Greek Life faculty and the fraternity chapters themselves. Once we determined the user experience, I sketched a user interface for the campus side of the application. From these sketches, Greg and I coded the platform and completed the final product on both the front-end and the back-end.
